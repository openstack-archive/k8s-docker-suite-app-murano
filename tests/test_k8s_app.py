            1. Create murano environment

            3. Initialize k8s cluster parameters and add app to env.

            8. Get k8s minions' ips and check that correct initial number
            of them was created and k8s api port is available on them.
            9. Run 'scaleNodesUp' action for k8s minions.

            k8s api port is available on all of them
            11. Run 'scaleNodesDown' action for k8s minions.
