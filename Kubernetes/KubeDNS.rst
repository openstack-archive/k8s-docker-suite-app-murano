DNS in Kubernetes Cluster deployed by Murano
--------------------------------------------

Kubernetes Cluster deployed by Murano offers a Kube-DNS cluster addon, which is
configured and enabled by default. The running Kubernetes Kube-DNS pod holds 3
containers:

* The kubedns container:

  * Watches changes in services and endpoints
  * Maintains in-memory lookup structures to service DNS requests

* The dnsmasq container adds DNS caching to improve performance
* The healthz container performing healthchecks for dnsmasq and kubedns

Additionally, kubelets on each node has been configured to tell individual containers
to use the DNS Serviceâ€™s IP to resolve DNS names. The DNS server watches the Kubernetes
API for new Services and creates a set of DNS records for each, so that every Service
defined in the cluster will be assigned a DNS name. As a result Pods are able to do
name resolution of Cluster Services automatically.

The Kubernetes cluster DNS server supports: Forward lookups (A records),
Service lookups (SRV records), Reverse IP address lookups (PTR records).

Kube-DNS addon in Kubernetes Cluster has following default settings:

* IP address of DNS server = 10.32.0.10
* Default Domain of DNS server = kubernetes.local

Above settings can be customized, if required.
